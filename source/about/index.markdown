In late August 2013 a few Ruby hackers in the OKC area decided that the
Ruby scene had been dormant for far too long.  They set out to change
that by forming okcruby, with the hopes that it would be a good way for
Oklahoma Rubyists to connect and share ideas.

[Rob Sullivan][] ([@DataChomp][]), from [RaiseMore][], [Michael Gorsuch][] ([@michaelgorsuch][]) from [GitHub][], and
[Jeremy Green][] ([@jagthedrummer][]) from [OctoLabs][] (who is very bad at Twitter) decided to join forces to reignite the
Ruby community in Oklahoma.  We hope you'll join us!
