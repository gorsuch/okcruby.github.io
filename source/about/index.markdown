In late August 2013 a few Ruby hackers in the OKC area decided that the
Ruby scene had been dormant for far too long.  They set out to change
that by forming okcruby, with the hopes that it would be a good way for
Oklahoma Rubyists to connect and share ideas. We hope you will join us.  
  
OKC Ruby meets the 2nd Thursday of every month, 11:30-12:30 at The Exchange
